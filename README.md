# Replication Code: Predicting the Harm of Military Trauma on Functioning: Bayesian Models of Moral Injury and PTSD Related Psychosocial Functioning


## To Do
- Demographics table: add study 2 and 3. Create output file.
- Univariate plots: edit to ensure they tell the story of zero-inflation
- bivariate plots: what story should be told with these? Consider their presentation more carefully.
- update 3rd dag to include participation
- consolidate and clean up the generative model folder
- recipes looks good, although study 1 has 6 combos which is a little unruly


## Overview

The code in this R Project is for analyzing a series of surveys of U.S. military veterans.
