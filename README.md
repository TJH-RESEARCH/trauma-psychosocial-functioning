# Replication Code: Predicting the Harm of Military Trauma on Functioning: Bayesian Models of Moral Injury and PTSD Related Psychosocial Functioning


## To Do
- stop repeating code ... merge diagnostics into one file, grouped by each diagnostic stat
- model comparison... save results, check warnings
- Extra ppcheck models... interpret and save 
- Average Marginal Effects numeric results

- missing data in Sample 3 PCL

- consistency in names (e.g., hurdle vs. zero-process vs. lostic; gamma vs. non-zero)

- Informative Priors for sample 3 
- consolidate and clean up the generative model folder. DAGs? with Bayesian models, the main approach is to use all the covariates you can... 

- check warnings in results section

- plot priors shape is ugly
- title for plot priors

- do something with the groups.R file


## Overview

The code in this R Project is for analyzing a series of surveys of U.S. military veterans.
