# Replication Code: Predicting the Harm of Military Trauma on Functioning: Bayesian Models of Moral Injury and PTSD Related Psychosocial Functioning


## To Do
- Informative Priors for sample 3 
- Sample plots from sample priors
- check warnings

- bivariate plots: what story should be told with these? Consider their presentation more carefully.
- update 3rd dag to include participation
- consolidate and clean up the generative model folder
- Assess model fits
- output/visuals from prior predictive checks?


## Overview

The code in this R Project is for analyzing a series of surveys of U.S. military veterans.
