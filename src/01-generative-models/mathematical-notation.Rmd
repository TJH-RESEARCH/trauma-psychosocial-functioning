# Model 1: Gaussian
$$
y \sim \text{Normal}(\mu, \sigma) \\
\mu = \\
\mu = \\
$$


# Model 2: Zero-Inflated Hurdle-Gamma

$$ f(y) = 
  \begin{cases}
      \pi & \text{if } y = 0 \\
      (1 - \pi) \text{Gamma} (\mu_i, \theta) & \text{if } y > 0\\
  \end{cases} $$
  
Where $\mu = E[y_i]$ is mean of the response.  

$\theta$ is dispersion/shape parameter of the gamma distribution.   
  
The mean-variance relationship for the gamma distribution is: $\text{Var}(y_i) = \theta \mu_i^2$

The mean $\mu_i$ is modeled via a log link function and a linear predictor.:
$$\text{log}(\mu_i) = \eta_i =  \alpha + \beta x_i $$

Where $\alpha$ is the intercept, $\beta$ is a vector of regression coefficients, $x_i$ is the vector of covariates for observation $i$, and $\eta_i$ is the linear predictor.

$$
y_i \sim \text{Gamma}(\mu_i, \theta) \\ 
\text{log}(\mu_i) = \alpha + \beta x_i 
$$

# Model 3: Gamma model

$$ y \sim \text{Gamma}(\mu_i, shape) \\ 
\text{log}(\mu_i) = intercept + \beta_1 * x_i$$
